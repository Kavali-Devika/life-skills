### 1. In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?

    The most interesting idea for me was how BJ Fogg emphasizes starting tiny—like flossing just one tooth instead of all teeth—to build a habit. He explains that small habits lead to big changes over time because they create a sense of success and momentum. This makes habit formation less intimidating and more achievable.

### 2. Tiny Habits by BJ Fogg - Core Message 
### How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A, and P?
    B = MAP stands for Behavior = Motivation × Ability × Prompt.

        - M (Motivation): How much you want to do it.

        - A (Ability): How easy it is to do.

        - P (Prompt): The trigger that reminds you to do it.

        How to use it:
        To make a new habit easier:

        1. Increase your ability (make the habit simpler).

        2. Reduce the need for motivation by starting very small.

        3. Use clear prompts to remind yourself to act.

### 3. Why it is important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of habit? (This is the most important concept in today's topic. Whatever you celebrate becomes a habit)

        Celebrating after a habit creates positive emotions associated with the action. This reinforces the habit in your brain, making it more likely to repeat. BJ Fogg says, “What you celebrate becomes a habit.”


### 4. 1% Better Every Day
### In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?

    The most interesting idea was the power of small, consistent improvements. Even 1% better every day compounds over time into massive progress. The story of athletes and successful people improving tiny things daily stuck out.

### 5: What is the book's perspective about Identity?

        The book emphasizes that habits are not just about outcomes, but about identity. Instead of “I want to run 5 km,” it’s better to think, “I am a runner.” Identity-based habits reinforce self-image, making habits easier to stick to.
